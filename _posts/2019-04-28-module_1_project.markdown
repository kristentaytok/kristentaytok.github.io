First major hurdle of the course done, and it feels good to be on the other side! Persistence pays--and I am learning each day that success in this course does not mean going through the lessons without falling behind, getting confused,  or being afraid, overwhelmed, or pulled in many different directions based on your personal or work priorities. This project was a testament to the contrary. 

There are so many directions one can take, and it can be scary and hard to figure out how to begin. Twelve sections and six weeks into the course, and I felt like a deer caught in the headlights when looking through the project instructions. With an open line of communication through our weekly one-on-one meetings, I was lucky to receive great advice and encouragement from my instructor to not let "analysis paralysis" keep me from completing the work or "perfection be the enemy of good". I'd like to share with you some tips and my experience with overcoming these barriers during this project, which perhaps you can incorporate into your own recipe for success.

### Feeling stuck?
* Start with inspiration from your peers, or other data scientists who have worked with this (or similar) data. 

Find code, visualizations, and even analysis that you like--but give them credit--and make it your own by doing your own analysis and thinking for yourself! Creativity is taking what's around you, and putting it together in a brand new way--not using your imagination or spending energy and time on researching ways to reinvent the wheel. You may also want to try finding data scientist business recommendation presentation examples if you aren't sure of how to format the non-technical presentation.

* Revisit the instructions. 
 
Sometimes you may have missed something in your first read-through that may make sense now. You can also revisit old lessons or labs to find code that you liked or refresh your memory on certain concepts or steps.

* Ask questions! 

You have two weeks to complete the project, and it won't do you any good scratching your head on something you may (or may not) need to know. 

* Just move!

I mean physically and literally. I found a few minutes of exercise can get the mind flowing, per the recommendation of my amazing educational coach! Sometimes a mental block can be resolved with a little dopamine burst of completing a productive task on your neverending checklist. And get a move on with your project! My rate-limiting step with this project was really just getting started. By exploring the data, you will begin to understandthe information and form your own questions before you know it! 

Good habits and first steps can start really small, but the payoff will be momentum that will carry you across the finish line feeling confident and capable. 

### Keep it simple and clear
There are 4 more projects and much more to learn between now and the end of the course. We don't have to throw everything we have learned in one Jupyter notebook, but it's great to leave detailed notes for yourself and others to help retrace your steps as you progress through the project and reproduce your results if needed. And it's okay to not understand everything at this point in the course or our career--so use this as a simple example where we can apply some of the skills we have learned and get comfortable with making our own Jupyter notebooks and Powerpoint presentations. I'm personally looking forward to getting fancier with my visualizations and learning more ways to analyze data through future assignments--which would not be possible if I overcomplicated this project.

This project involves writing for very different audiences, and achieving many different deliverables. Keeping your methods and objectives clear will go a long way! Some concepts that started to blur for me were:

1. How to pick the predictor variables for answering my business questions for the non-technical Powerpoint audience vs. for my regression model. The correlation does not *have to* be high for the predictor variables you choose to explore for business analysis of relationships between the predictor variables and target variable, but regression model predictor variables should include those with stronger correlation to the target variable.   
2. Visualizations (which don't necessarily require regressional analysis) can help answer business questions, while regression analysis is used for making predictions. Your business recommendations do not have to rely on insights you uncover from your linear regression model. These approaches of answering questions through visualizations during exploration vs. linear regression models can be kept separate for now in meeting our objectives for this project. 

In my line of work, I am required to write information for customers that is at or below 6th grade reading level. I also provide written information to highly-educated audiences, but found that their learning requirements are similar. We are all constantly bombarded by new information through emails, social media, journal or electronic publications, etc. and it comes at no surprise that our ability to get audiences to select, process, and retain information becomes increasingly challenging. Keeping your scope, message, and delivery simple will take your information much farther than a having a bulletproof model with advanced analysis accompanied by busy visuals and "walls" of text.   

### My final tips
1. Heed my advice above
2. Breathe
3. Stay focused, passionate, and curious!
