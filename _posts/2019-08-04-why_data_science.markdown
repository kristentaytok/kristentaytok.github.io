My career as a pharmacist has fulfilled my passions in helping others: first at the one-to-one level in direct patient care, and now at the population level managing medication and formulary decisions for an entire health plan serving hundreds of thousands of patients. What I didn’t expect to find was that I developed a love for data & analytics after monitoring trends in drug utilization, health outcomes, and provider performance. Data is especially important in my role as a manager; one needs a strong background in analytics to correctly identify the needs of a population, monitor outcomes, and recommend credible business decisions—decisions that can affect thousands at a time.  

In my eyes, the next big challenge is healthcare. I see firsthand how clinicians are considerably unequipped to handle data. We need more clinician data scientists. Healthcare data is spotty, messy, and difficult to work with—yet I believe it can provide invaluable insights to extending lives and keeping people safe, especially in our currently fractured healthcare systems. 

In an era of data richness, I believe there are countless unanswered questions about what works and what doesn't work in healthcare, what’s missing in the data, what biases are yet to be discovered & hopefully reconciled, and how we can make healthcare easier in a time of mass provider burnout and skyrocketing costs. In my search for knowledge of data science and its applications, I also came across materials for data and storytelling. And then it clicked: with this trifecta of skillsets: data, storytelling, and clinical knowledge, a clinician data scientist can “do good better”—and help bridge the many, many gaps in healthcare today.
